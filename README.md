The rapid proliferation of IoT-based healthcare devices has enabled real-time data collection, monitoring, and personalized care. However, the generation of diverse and heterogeneous data formats, such as JSON, XML, and HL7, poses significant challenges to interoperability, data integration, and efficient decision-making. The lack of standardization among these data formats creates barriers to seamless communication between devices, reducing the effectiveness of IoT-driven healthcare systems and hindering scalable solutions.

To address these challenges, this paper presents a middleware solution designed to harmonize data across diverse IoT ecosystems. The middleware employs a hybrid approach, combining rule-based techniques with automated data format classification. It detects incoming data structures, classifies them into their respective formats, and harmonizes them into a universal schema, enabling seamless data exchange and compatibility across heterogeneous devices and systems.
The proposed solution is evaluated on a curated dataset containing JSON, XML, and HL7 samples, achieving high accuracy in format detection and efficient transformation into a unified format. This demonstrates the middleware’s ability to handle complex and varied data structures, reducing integration complexity and enabling efficient decision-making. Furthermore, the framework is scalable,
adaptable to evolving data formats, and capable of integrating new standards in dynamic IoT environments.

This research significantly advances IoT interoperability in healthcare by providing a robust, scalable solution for addressing data heterogeneity. Moreover, the middleware’s applicability extends beyond healthcare to smart city applications, such as traffic management, public safety, energy optimization, and environmental monitoring. By facilitating seamless communication and integration across diverse domains, the proposed middleware lays the foundation for interconnected, efficient, and intelligent urban ecosystems, aligning with the vision of sustainable and data-driven smart cities.
